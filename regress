# What is the goal of this regression test script?
# How much memory should it require? Should it test and adapt?
# Should it assume 64-bit or 32-bit Judy?
# Should it figure out which?
# Should it work with either?
# Is it supposed to test Judy1LHTime and Judy1LHCheck or just Judy?

# For now it is a hoop test that works with both 64-bit and
# 32-bit Judy.

# Use a -DDEBUG build.
